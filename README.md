## OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) vs. PP (Procedural Programming)

### Procedural Programming
is a step by step approach of the problem on programming. By creating procedures(also known as routines or functions), the program follow the flow of the system flow that needs to be done.
Examples:
FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal and C

### Object Oriented Programming
is grouping all the variables and functions in one object based on the group they are related to. The concept is getting the block of code ready to be used by another program flow.

Main advantage of using OOP is that it helps the developer prevent repeating the code created that makes it more convenient and easier and faster.

Examples:
Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, Objective-C, Dart, Swift and Scala
